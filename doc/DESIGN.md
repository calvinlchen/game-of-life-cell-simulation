# Cell Society Design Final
### 3
- Kyaira Boughton (keb125)
- Jessica Chen (jc939)
- Calvin Chen (clc162)


## Team Roles and Responsibilities

 * Kyaira Boughton (keb125)
   * All configuration related tasks such as the features under configuration and creating xml documents for testing.

 * Jessica Chen (jc939)
   * Simulation related features as well as providing API to provide dynamic functionality for some of the dynamic updates.

 * Calvin Chen (clc162)
   * View related features.

## Design goals

#### What Features are Easy to Add
* Add new simulations, parameters and states to existing simulations, new neighborhood types.


## High-level Design
view / model (simulation + configuration)

#### Core Classes
folder structure and core interactions (high level uml)

## Assumptions that Affect the Design
* I need to go through these for simulation theres a lot of random simulations I had

#### Features Affected by Assumptions
* erm RPS? general game of life?


## Significant differences from Original Plan


## How to Add Features
