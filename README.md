This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: 1 / 28

 * Finish Date: 3 / 6

 * Hours Spent:
   * Jessica
     * Plan: 3 hr
     * Basic: 16 hr?
     * Robust: 24 hr?
     * Change: 36 hr?
     * Additional Doc's/Presentation: 12 hr?
     * some of this time was doing like things together so I guess in total: 80?
     * I have no sense of time though

### Running the Program

 * Main class:
   * found in `main/java/cellsociety/Main.java`

 * Data files needed: 
   * all found in `data`
     * this is where to find the XML projects ot the test the simulation
   * also need the files in `src/resources` 
     * this includes the logging configuration
     * resource properties for strings displayed and style guides for view

 * Format of XML files:
   <!-- Ky can you fill this part out -->

 * Interesting Information:
   * Interesting XML Files: 
   <!-- Ky can you do this -->

   * Key/Mouse inputs:
   <!-- Calvin can you do this -->


### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:
   * Files will all be located in the same location
   * For more detail about the simulation assumptions look into the design doc to avoid redundancy
    <!-- Jessica later link the specifics -->

### For Grading
 * Known Bugs:

 * Features implemented / Features unimplemented
   * Look into the checklist to see the detailed breakdown and how the project could support unimplemnted features

 * Noteworthy Features:


### Assignment Impressions
 * Jessica: I really liked the assignment itself as a whole, especially the iterational steps as we learned about the design patterns, I thought that was good (ex. each checkpoint there was a new simulation that either challenged or validated prior assumptions).
   * Hoever, one thing that could maybe be improved is like with some of the refactoring periods, even though we had two weeks to refactor, the times we learned the main thing that would help us refactor was in the second week so sometimes the first week kinda just felt silly.
